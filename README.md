# opencode-with-claude

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg)](LICENSE)

Use [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai) with your [Claude Max](https://claude.ai) subscription.

## What this is

An [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai) plugin that runs [opencode-claude-max-proxy](https://github.com/rynfar/opencode-claude-max-proxy) for you: **start OpenCode once** and the proxy comes up with it; **quit OpenCode** and the proxy stops. No separate proxy CLI or Docker container to manage.

**Compared to running the proxy yourself:**

- **One process to think about** — OpenCode owns the proxy lifecycle (start/stop) instead of you juggling two things.
- **Several OpenCode windows at once** — each instance gets its own proxy on an OS-assigned port, so ports do not collide and you avoid session issues from sharing one proxy across instances.
- **Explicit session headers** — the plugin adds session tracking on outgoing API calls, so the proxy does not have to infer sessions from fingerprints alone.

## How It Works

```

## Quick Start

The plugin hooks into OpenCode's plugin system. When OpenCode launches, it starts the proxy, configures the Anthropic provider, and cleans everything up on exit.

**1. Authenticate with Claude (one-time)**

```bash
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
claude login
```

**2. Add to your `opencode.json`**

Global (`~/.config/opencode/opencode.json`) or project-level:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
  "plugin": ["opencode-with-claude"],
  "provider": {
    "anthropic": {
      "options": {
        "baseURL": "http://127.0.0.1:3456",
        "apiKey": "dummy"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

> **Note:** The `apiKey` is a placeholder — authentication goes through your Claude Max session via `claude login`, not an API key. The `baseURL` is the default proxy port. If port 3456 is already in use (e.g., another OpenCode instance), the plugin automatically starts the proxy on a different port and overrides the `baseURL` at runtime.

**3. Run OpenCode**

```bash
opencode
```

## Troubleshooting

### "Claude Code CLI not found"

```bash
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
```

### "Claude not authenticated"

```bash
claude login
```

This opens a browser for OAuth. Your Claude Max subscription credentials are needed.

### "Proxy failed to start"

1. Check Claude auth: `claude auth status`
2. Ensure your internet connection is working
3. If using a manual port override, check if it's in use: `lsof -i :$CLAUDE_PROXY_PORT`

## FAQ

**Do I need an Anthropic API key?**

No. The proxy authenticates through your Claude Max subscription via `claude login`. The plugin automatically sets a dummy API key — it's never actually used for authentication.

**What happens if my Claude Max subscription expires?**

The proxy will fail to authenticate. Run `claude auth status` to check. You'll need an active Claude Max ($100/mo) or Claude Max with Team ($200/mo) subscription.

**Can I use this with multiple projects at the same time?**

Yes. The first instance uses port 3456 by default. Additional instances automatically fall back to a random OS-assigned port, so they all work simultaneously without any extra configuration.

**Is this the same as using the Anthropic API?**

Not exactly. The proxy translates between the Anthropic REST API format and the Claude Agent SDK. From OpenCode's perspective it looks like the API, but under the hood it uses your Claude Max session. Rate limits are determined by your Claude Max subscription, not API tier limits.

**Why `claude login` instead of an API key?**

Claude Max doesn't provide API access. Authentication goes through the Claude Code CLI's OAuth flow, which grants an Agent SDK session token tied to your subscription.
